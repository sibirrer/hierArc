Hierarchical analysis of strong lensing systems to infer lens properties and cosmological parameters simultaneously.

The software is originated from `Birrer et al. 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02941>`_ and is in active development.

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://hierarc.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* The software allows to fit lenses with measured time delays and lenses with imaging and kinematics constraints with parameters described on the ensemble level.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install hierarc --user


Usage
-----

The full analysis of `Birrer et al. 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02941>`_ is publicly available `here <https://github.com/TDCOSMO/hierarchy_analysis_2020_public>`_ .
A forecast based on hierArc is presented by `Birrer & Treu 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06157>`_
and the notebooks are available `here <https://github.com/sibirrer/TDCOSMO_forecast>`_.
For example use cases we refer to the notebooks of these analyses.
